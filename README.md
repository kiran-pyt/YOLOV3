# YOLOV3
The primary objective of this project is to have a comprehensive understanding of the architectural design of YOLOv3. The repository consists of four files that contain implementations of the YOLOv3 architecture utilizing the Keras, OpenCV, and PyTorch frameworks, each implemented independently. I have effectively applied transfer learning by utilizing the Keras and OpenCV packages, specifically employing the COCO weights and COCO names.

 

However, it's worth noting that out of the three models, the Keras and OpenCV model outperformed the Yolo PyTorch framework. This difference in performance may be attributed to the fact that the Yolo model requires extensive training with PyTorch, which could lead to improvements in results. In particular, training the PyTorch model using a GPU can significantly enhance its performance and accuracy.
